# Factorio Mod Template
This is based off of [Raiguard's](https://github.com/raiguard) mod template. Replace `modname` in all files, then modify `src/info.json` accordingly.

Feel free to use it if you like, but be sure to set the env variable `factorioBinaryPath` or modify `launch.json`, as well as changing `info.json` to have you as the author and contact.
